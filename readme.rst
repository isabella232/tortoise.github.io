Tortoise ORM static site
########################

The static site should be accessible on https://tortoise.github.io/ and automatically deployed by Travis when a change is pushed on the ``docs`` branch.

Please have a look at http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/content.html to write docs.

Currently we should put release info in ``content/releases/`` and misc in ``content/``.

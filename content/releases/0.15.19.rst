Due to Python3.6 support being removed, we decided to declare 0.15 series as a pseudo LTS release


    There are several known issues with Python 3.6 and the ``contextvars`` backport where it confuses the context, and connection pooling/transactions leak.

    The problems are worse when using connection pooling (which is the default behaviour).

    We strongly recommend that anyone upgrades to Python 3.7 or 3.8 as soon as is possible.

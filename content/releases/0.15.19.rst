To update and keep Py3.6 compatibility do::

    pip install -U tortoise-orm<0.16

0.15 series is now pseudo LTS (until May), as it is the last version to support Python3.6.

    There are several known issues with Python 3.6 and the ``contextvars`` backport where it confuses the context, and connection pooling/transactions leak.

    The problems are worse when using connection pooling (which is the default behaviour).

    We strongly recommend that anyone upgrades to Python 3.7 or 3.8 as soon as is possible.

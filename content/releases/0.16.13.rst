We are proud to announce the 0.16.13 release of Tortoise ORM

To update/install do::

    pip install -U tortoise-orm

This release is primarily a minor feature release:

Changes
=======
* Default install of ``tortoise-orm`` now installs with no C-dependencies, if you want to use the C accelerators, please do a ``pip install tortoise-orm[accel]`` instead.
* Added ``<instance>.clone()`` method that will create a cloned instance in memory. To persist it you still need to call ``.save()``
* ``.clone()`` will raise a ``ParamsError`` if tortoise can't generate a primary key. In that case do a ``.clone(pk=<newval>)``
* If manually setting the primary key value to ``None`` and the primary key can be automatically generated, this will create a new record. We however still recommend the ``.clone()`` method instead.
* ``.save()`` can be forced to do a create by setting ``force_create=True``
* ``.save()`` can be forced to do an update by setting ``force_update=True``
* Setting ``update_fields`` for a ``.save()`` operation will strongly prefer to do an update if possible

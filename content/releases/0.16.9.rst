We are proud to announce the 0.16.9 release of Tortoise ORM

To update/install do::

    pip install -U tortoise-orm

This release is primarily a bugfix release, but also includes some features:

Bugfix
======
* Pydantic models with a Primary Key that is also a raw field of a relation is now not hidden when ``exclude_raw_fields=True`` as it is a critically important field
* Raise an informative error when a field is set as nullable and primary key at the same time
* Foreign key id's are now described to have the positive-integer range of the field it is related to
* Fixed prefetching over OneToOne relations
* Fixed ``__contains`` for non-text fields (e.g. ``JSONB``)

Features
========
* Support ``F`` expression in ``.save()`` now
* ``IntEnumField`` accept valid int value and ``CharEnumField`` accept valid str value
* Pydantic models get created with globally unique identifier
* Leaf-detection to minimize duplicate Pydantic model creation

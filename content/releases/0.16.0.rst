We are proud to announce the 0.16 series of Tortoise ORM

Pydantic suport
---------------

The main new feature is Pydantic serialisation support!
Currently this is only for serialisation (no deserialisation support yet), but supports everything required for serialising complex relation-heavy objects.

We have documented many of the use cases (including some tutorials) `in our on-line docs <https://tortoise-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contrib/pydantic.html>`_

Other new features
------------------

* Automatically uses docstrings and doc-comments ``#:`` to populate field/table metadata
* Partial early-init support for cases when you want to have access to complete models before establishing a DB connection.
* Allow usage of ``F`` expressions to in annotations.
* Now negative number with ``.limit(...)`` and ``.offset(...)`` raise ParamsError.
* Allow usage of Function to ``queryset.update()``.
* Add ability to supply ``distinct`` flag to Aggregate.

Removals
--------

* Removed ``tortoise.aggregation`` as this was deprecated since 0.14.0
* Removed ``start_transaction`` as it has been broken since 0.15.0
* Removed support for Python 3.6 / PyPy-3.6, as it has been broken since 0.15.0

  If you still need Python 3.6 support, you can install tortoise-orm<0.16 as we will still backport critical bugfixes to the 0.15 branch for a while.

Thanks
------

We are proud to announce the 0.16.2 & 0.15.20 releases of Tortoise ORM

To update/install do::

    pip install -U tortoise-orm

or for 0.15 legacy series::

    pip install -U tortoise-orm<0.16

These are bugfix releases, and we recommend you upgrade.

Bugfixes
========
* Default ``values()`` & ``values_list()`` now includes annotations.
* Annotations over joins now work correctly with ``values()`` & ``values_list()``
* Ensure ``GROUP BY`` precedes ``HAVING`` to ensure that filtering by aggregates work correctly.
* Cast ``BooleanField`` values correctly on SQLite & MySQL
* Fix bug with join query with aggregation (only 0.16.2)

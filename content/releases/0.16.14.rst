This release is primarily a minor fix release:

Changes
=======
* We now do CI runs on a Windows VM as well, to try and prevent Windows specific regressions.
* Make ``F`` expression work with ``QuerySet.filter()``.
* Include ``py.typed`` in source distribution.
* Added ``datetime`` parsing from ``int`` for ``fields.DatetimeField``.
* ``get_or_create`` passes the ``using_db=`` on if provided.
* Allow custom ``loop`` and ``connection_class`` parameters to be passed on to asyncpg.

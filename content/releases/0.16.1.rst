We are proud to announce the 0.16.1 release of Tortoise ORM

To update/install do::

    pip install -U tortoise-orm

We added a `FastAPI example <https://tortoise-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/fastapi.html>`_ with a simple integration.

Enahncements
============
* ``QuerySetSingle`` now has better code completion
* Created Pydantic models will now have the basic validation elements:

  * ``required`` is correctly populated for required fields
  * ``nullable`` is added to the schema where nulls are accepted
  * ``maxLength`` for CharFields
  * ``minimum`` & ``maximum`` values for integer fields

  To get Pydantic to handle nullable/defaulted fields correctly one should do a ``**user.dict(exclude_unset=True)`` when passing values to a Model class.

* Added ``FastAPI`` helper that is based on the ``starlette`` helper but optionally adds helpers to catch and report with proper error ``DoesNotExist`` and ``IntegrityError`` Tortoise exceptions.
* Allows a Pydantic model to exclude all read-only fields by setting ``exclude_readonly=True`` when calling ``pydantic_model_creator``.
* a Tortoise ``PydanticModel`` now provides two extra helper functions:

  * ``from_queryset``: Returns a ``List[PydanticModel]`` which is the format that e.g. FastAPI expects
  * ``from_queryset_single``: allows one to avoid calling ``await`` multiple times to get the object and all its related items.

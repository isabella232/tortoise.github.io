We are on the road to the big version 1.0

You can see our `v1.0 project page <https://github.com/tortoise/tortoise-orm/projects/1>`_
and the `tracker issue <https://github.com/tortoise/tortoise-orm/issues/19>`_

We would love some extra testing of what we currently have, and assistance to get over the line.

The v1.0 will be our first proper LTS release, as we will immediately jump to v1.1 for our unstable release series.
We will commit to backporting any critical fixes to it.
